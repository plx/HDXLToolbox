// MARK: AlgebraicProduct - Definition
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------- //

/// Basic protocol for algebraic products (e.g. "nominally-typed tuples").
///
/// Rarely for direct use; expect, instead, to use the arity-specific protocols
/// that inherit from `AlgebraicProduct`.
///
/// The *reason* we *need* protocols for the product types is b/c it's important
/// to offer them in both (a) "inline" (e.g. flat struct) and (b) "COW" (e.g.
/// storage on heap, implemented as class, wrapped in COW-style struct). Our only
/// useful abstraction tool right now is to "protocolize" each arity and then make
/// types that use/vend products generic in the representation thereof.
///
/// For `Sum` the issue is less urgent b/c *in general* we can safely assume that
/// the constituent types are well-designed--e.g. not too big, not too much ARC
/// traffic, etc.--and thus for any given concrete parameterization of any given
/// `Sum` type, our size is only marginally-larger than the largest constituent
/// and our ARC traffic is only, at-worst, as bad as the worst of its constituents
/// (which, by assumption, we believe will be "not *that* bad").
